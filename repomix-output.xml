# ADR 001: Architectural Choice - Service-Oriented Monolith

**Date:** 2024-05-23

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The initial codebase had business logic (for points, achievements, referrals) tightly coupled within the API controller classes (`Canna_Rewards_Controller`, etc.). This made adding new features or modifying existing ones "cumbersome," as a single change required editing multiple files and understanding a wide range of implicit dependencies. The architecture was brittle and did not have a clear separation of concerns.

## Decision

We will refactor the backend into a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** within a single WordPress plugin (a "well-organized monolith").

This involves creating a new `/services` directory. Each service will be a PHP class responsible for a single, distinct business domain:
-   `EconomyService`: Manages all logic for points and redemptions.
-   `GamificationService`: Manages all logic for achievements.
-   `ReferralService`: Manages all logic for the referral program.
-   And so on.

The API controllers in `/includes/api/` will be refactored to be "lean." Their only responsibility is to handle the HTTP request/response cycle and delegate all business logic to the appropriate service.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **High Cohesion / Loose Coupling:** Logic is now grouped by business domain, making it easier to find, understand, and maintain.
-   **Increased Testability:** Each service can be instantiated and tested in isolation, improving code quality and reliability.
-   **Improved Developer Velocity:** Adding new features is simplified. For example, a "Product Reviews" feature would involve creating a new, self-contained `ReviewService` without modifying the core economic or gamification logic.

**Negative:**
-   Introduces a slightly higher level of abstraction than a simple controller-based model.
-   Requires discipline to maintain the separation of concerns and prevent services from becoming overly dependent on each other.

**Rejected Alternative: Microservices**
A full microservices architecture was considered but rejected due to the immense operational complexity (multiple deployments, databases, network latency) which is not justified at the current scale of the project. This SOA monolith provides 80% of the benefits with 10% of the complexity.

# ADR 002: Inter-Service Communication - Event-Driven Model

**Date:** 2024-05-23

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

With the move to a Service-Oriented Architecture (ADR 001), we need a defined pattern for how services communicate. A direct-call approach (e.g., `EconomyService` directly calling `new GamificationService()`) would re-introduce tight coupling and create a tangled web of dependencies between services.

## Decision

We will implement an **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** for inter-service communication. This will be facilitated by a simple, static `Event` broadcaster class (implementing the Observer pattern).

-   **Broadcasting:** Services will not call each other directly. Instead, after completing their core logic, they will broadcast a past-tense event, such as `Event::broadcast('product_scanned', $payload)`. The broadcaster knows nothing about who is listening.
-   **Listening:** Services that need to react to an event will subscribe to it in their constructor using `Event::listen('product_scanned', [$this, 'handler_method'])`.

The `RulesEngineService` will be deprecated, and its orchestration responsibilities will be distributed to these autonomous listeners.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Ultimate Decoupling:** Services are completely decoupled. The `EconomyService` has no knowledge of the `GamificationService` or `ReferralService`.
-   **Extensibility:** Adding new, cross-cutting logic is incredibly cheap and safe. A new service (e.g., `FraudDetectionService`) can simply listen for existing events without requiring any changes to the core services.
-   **Architectural Purity:** The codebase becomes a direct reflection of the business processes. Logic is clean, isolated, and easy to trace from event to listener.
-   **Foundation for Asynchronicity:** This pattern is a prerequisite for moving to a more scalable, asynchronous queue-based system in the future.

**Negative:**
-   **Increased Indirection:** The control flow is less explicit. To understand what happens after a scan, a developer must look for the `product_scanned` event broadcast and then find all the registered listeners for that event. This requires a bit more discipline to trace.

<file path="docs/ADR/003-psr4-autoloader-and-namespacing.md">
# ADR 003: Code Loading - Composer PSR-4 Autoloader

**Date:** 2024-05-23

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The initial codebase used a long, manually maintained list of `require_once` statements in the main plugin file. This is a fragile, error-prone, and outdated method for loading PHP files. It created a hidden dependency on file load order and increased the cognitive overhead for developers.

## Decision

We will completely remove the manual `require_once` system and adopt the industry-standard **PSR-4 autoloader managed by Composer.**

1.  **Namespacing:** All classes will be moved into a root `CannaRewards` namespace.
2.  **Directory Structure:** All class files will be reorganized into a PSR-4 compliant directory structure under `includes/CannaRewards/`.
3.  **File Naming:** All files will be renamed to match their class names exactly (e.g., `class EconomyService` will live in `includes/CannaRewards/Services/EconomyService.php`).
4.  **`composer.json`:** The `autoload` directive will be configured to map the `CannaRewards\` namespace to the `includes/CannaRewards/` directory.
5.  **Bootstrap:** The main plugin file will be gutted and replaced with a single call to `require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';`.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Modern Standard:** Aligns the project with modern PHP development best practices.
-   **Eliminates Load Order Errors:** The autoloader automatically resolves dependencies, removing an entire class of potential fatal errors.
-   **Improved Developer Experience:** Developers no longer need to manage a long list of includes. New classes are automatically available for use after running `composer dump-autoload`.
-   **Code Clarity:** Namespaces prevent conflicts with other plugins and make the code's structure explicit and easy to understand.

**Negative:**
-   Requires a one-time, meticulous effort to rename and move all existing class files.
-   Adds Composer as a hard dependency for the project's development.

# ADR 004: Data Contracts - OpenAPI and Data Taxonomy

**Date:** 2024-05-23

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The communication contract between the frontend PWA, the backend API, and the external Customer Data Platform (CDP) was not formally defined. This leads to ambiguity, potential for inconsistent data, and difficulty in parallel development.

## Decision

We will adopt a strict "contract-first" approach for all data interfaces, formalized in two key documents:

1.  **The API Contract (`openapi.yaml`):**
    *   An OpenAPI 3.0 specification will be the single source of truth for the backend's REST API.
    *   It will define every endpoint, its parameters, and its exact request/response schemas.
    *   This enables automated documentation, client/server code generation, and API testing.

2.  **The Data Taxonomy & Tracking Plan:**
    *   A human-readable document (e.g., in Notion) that defines the complete schema for all events sent to the CDP.
    *   It will define standardized, reusable objects (`user_snapshot`, `product_snapshot`, `event_context`) to ensure all analytical data is consistent and richly contextual.
    *   All new tracking requests must be formalized in this document *before* implementation.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Enables Parallel Development:** Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously against the shared OpenAPI contract.
-   **Single Source of Truth:** Eliminates ambiguity. The contracts, not the code, are the ultimate authority on how the systems communicate.
-   **High-fidelity Data:** The Data Taxonomy ensures that our most valuable asset—our customer data—is clean, consistent, and structured for maximum utility by AI and marketing automation platforms.
-   **Improved Onboarding:** New developers can understand the entire data flow of the application by reading these two documents.

**Negative:**
-   Adds a layer of process. Development of a new endpoint now requires an upfront investment in defining its contract. This is a deliberate trade-off in favor of long-term quality and maintainability.

<file path="docs/ADR/007-Formalizing-Internal-Data-Contracts-with-DTOs-and-Value-Objects.md">
ADR 007: Formalizing Internal Data Contracts with DTOs and Value Objects
Status: Proposed
Context:
Currently, data passed between internal layers of the application (e.g., from a Service to a Controller, or from a Repository to a Service) is primarily in the form of associative arrays. This is a common source of bugs. A typo in an array key ('points_balanc') is not caught until runtime. Furthermore, primitive types like string and int do not carry any business context (e.g., is this int a UserId or a ProductId?). This leads to scattered validation logic and makes the code harder to reason about.
Decision:
We will implement two patterns to create strong, internal data contracts:
Value Objects: For core, primitive-like business concepts, we will create small, immutable classes that validate themselves upon creation. An EmailAddress class, for instance, cannot be instantiated with a malformed string. A UserId cannot be created with a negative integer. This makes invalid states unrepresentable.
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): For all structured data moving between application layers (especially data returned from services), we will use simple, public-property DTO classes. Instead of a service returning a complex array, it will return a UserProfileDTO object. This provides IDE autocompletion, static analysis benefits, and serves as self-documenting code.
Consequences:
Positive:
Eliminates an entire class of bugs: Typos in data keys and passing of invalid primitive types are caught at creation time or by static analysis, not in production.
Massively Improved Developer Experience: IDE autocompletion makes the code faster and more enjoyable to write.
Self-Documenting: The DTO classes themselves become the definitive, always-up-to-date documentation for the application's internal data structures.
Negative:
Increased Boilerplate: This requires writing more small classes, which can feel verbose for a simple application. This is a trade-off for long-term stability and clarity.

<file path="docs/ADR/008-Formalizing-Observability-and-debugging.md">
ADR 008: Formalizing Observability and Debugging
Status: Proposed
Context:
The current debugging workflow relies on error_log() and manual inspection. This is inefficient and provides insufficient context to diagnose issues, especially in a production environment. When an error occurs, it's difficult to know which user was affected, what data they submitted, or the sequence of events that led to the failure.
Decision:
We will implement a three-tiered observability strategy to provide a professional-grade debugging experience.
Local Development: Xdebug. We will adopt Xdebug as the standard for local development. This enables interactive, step-through debugging, allowing developers to pause code execution and inspect the full application state at any point. This replaces the inefficient var_dump(); die(); workflow.
Structured Logging: Monolog. All error_log() calls will be replaced with a centralized LoggerService built on the Monolog library. All logs will be written as structured JSON, including rich context (e.g., user_id, request data, exception traces). This makes logs searchable, filterable, and machine-readable.
Production Surveillance: Sentry. We will integrate an error tracking service (like Sentry) into the production environment. This will automatically capture all unhandled exceptions, group them, and provide a rich dashboard with the full context needed to diagnose and resolve production bugs before users report them.
Consequences:
Positive:
Drastically Reduced Debugging Time: Step-debugging with Xdebug can reduce the time to find the root cause of a local bug by an order of magnitude.
Actionable Production Alerts: Sentry provides immediate, context-rich alerts for production failures, turning unknown problems into well-defined tasks.
Improved System Visibility: Structured logs provide a clear, searchable history of application events, crucial for understanding complex user interactions.
Negative:
Initial Setup Cost: Each of these tools requires a one-time setup and configuration investment.
Minor Performance Overhead: Production logging and error tracking add a small amount of overhead to each request. This is a standard and acceptable cost for production visibility.

<file path="docs/ADR/009-decoupling-http-logic-with-responders">
ADR 009: Decoupling HTTP Logic with Responders
Status: Proposed
Context:
Currently, API controllers are responsible for creating WP_REST_Response and WP_Error objects. This couples the application's business logic outcomes to the specifics of the HTTP layer (e.g., status codes, headers). This leads to minor inconsistencies and makes the controllers harder to test in isolation.
Decision:
We will implement the Responder Pattern. Controllers will no longer return WordPress response objects. Instead, they will return simple, dedicated "Responder" objects that represent a specific outcome (e.g., ResourceCreatedResponder, ValidationFailedResponder, NotFoundResponder). A thin middleware layer in the REST API bootstrap will be responsible for taking these Responder objects and converting them into the final WP_REST_Response.
Consequences:
Positive:
Perfect API Consistency: A NotFoundResponder will always generate the exact same 404 Not Found response, with the same JSON structure, regardless of which controller returned it. This strengthens the API contract.
Decoupled and Testable Controllers: Controllers now only contain application logic. They are no longer concerned with HTTP status codes, making them simpler and easier to unit test.
Clearer Application Flow: The return type of a controller method explicitly states the possible outcomes of the action.
Negative:
Increased Indirection: This adds another layer of abstraction between the controller and the final HTTP response.

# CannaRewards Contribution Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** `LOCKED-IN`

## 🚀 Welcome

Thank you for contributing to the CannaRewards platform. This document is the single source of truth for our development workflow, coding standards, and architectural principles. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for all contributions to ensure the long-term health, quality, and maintainability of the codebase.

## 🏛️ Core Architectural Principles

Before writing any code, it is essential to understand the architectural philosophy that governs this project. All contributions will be evaluated against these principles. The "why" behind these decisions is documented in our **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** located in `/docs/adr`.

1.  **Service-Oriented Monolith (ADR-001):** The backend is a "well-organized monolith," not a distributed system. All business logic is encapsulated in distinct, single-responsibility services (e.g., `EconomyService`, `GamificationService`). Controllers are thin and stateless.
2.  **Event-Driven Communication (ADR-002):** Services are fully decoupled and communicate asynchronously via a central `Event` broadcaster. Services **do not** call each other directly. They listen for events and react to them.
3.  **Contracts First (ADR-003):** All data interfaces are defined before implementation.
    -   The **API Contract (`openapi.yaml`)** is the immutable blueprint for the REST API.
    -   The **Data Taxonomy (Notion)** is the immutable blueprint for all CDP events.
    -   **Any change to an API or a CDP event must be proposed and approved in these documents *before* a single line of code is written.**

## ⚙️ The Development Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

We follow a structured workflow to ensure consistency and quality.

### Step 1: The Ticket

-   All work must begin with a ticket in our project management system (e.g., Jira, Linear, Trello).
-   A ticket must have a clear title, a detailed description of the user story or bug, and explicit **Acceptance Criteria**.

### Step 2: The Branch

-   All work must be done on a feature branch created from the `develop` branch.
-   **Branch Naming Convention:** Branches must be named using the format `[type]/[ticket-id]-[short-description]`.
    -   `feat/CR-123-wishlist-api`
    -   `fix/CR-124-cors-issue-on-claim`
    -   `chore/CR-125-update-dependencies`
-   The `main` and `develop` branches are protected. Direct pushes are disabled.

### Step 3: The Code

-   **Code Style & Quality:** Code style is non-negotiable and is automatically enforced by a **Husky pre-commit hook**.
    -   **Frontend:** ESLint and Prettier are used.
    -   **Backend:** PHPCS with the WordPress Coding Standards rule set is used.
    -   **Commits that do not pass linting will be automatically blocked.**
-   **In-Code Documentation:** All public classes and methods **must** have a complete PHPDoc or JSDoc block explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
-   **Testing:** All new business logic added to a Service **must** be accompanied by a corresponding unit test (PHPUnit for backend). All new user-facing flows on the frontend **must** be accompanied by a corresponding End-to-End (E2E) test (Cypress/Playwright).

### Step 4: The Pull Request (PR)

The Pull Request is our primary quality gate.

-   All feature branches must be merged into `develop` via a PR.
-   **PR Title:** The PR title must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This is mandatory as it is used to automate changelogs.
    -   `feat: Implement Wishlist API endpoints`
    -   `fix: Resolve fatal error in GamificationService`
    -   `docs: Update OpenAPI spec for the new Dashboard endpoint`
-   **PR Description:** The PR description must be filled out using our template:
    -   **Link to Ticket:** A mandatory link to the corresponding project management ticket.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** A clear, concise explanation of what was built or fixed.
    -   **Testing Instructions:** A step-by-step guide for the reviewer on how to manually verify the changes in a staging environment.
-   **Automated Checks (CI):** A PR cannot be merged until all automated checks (linting, tests, project build) have passed. The "Merge" button will be disabled.
-   **Code Review:** All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. For solo developers, this means performing a thorough self-review, stepping through every line of code as if you were another person.

### Step 5: The Merge & Deploy

-   Once a PR is approved and all checks have passed, it can be merged into `develop`.
-   A merge to `develop` automatically triggers a deployment to the **Staging** environment.
-   Releases to production are done by creating a new PR from `develop` into `main`. A merge to `main` automatically triggers a deployment to the **Production** environment.

## 🪵 Logging & Debugging

-   **Backend:** Use the standard `error_log()` function for debugging. Do not leave `var_dump()` or `echo` statements in committed code.
-   **Frontend:** Use `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, and `console.error()` appropriately. Remove all debugging logs before submitting a PR unless they are providing a valuable, intentional warning to other developers.

By adhering to these rules, we ensure that the CannaRewards platform remains a clean, stable, and professional codebase that is a pleasure to work on.

<file path="docs/Project genesis/project_genesis.md">
Of course. Understood.

Here is the `PROJECT_GENESIS.md` document, rewritten to be purely analytical, objective, and devoid of figurative language.

---

### **`PROJECT_GENESIS.md` (Analytical Edition)**

**Status:** `LOCKED-IN`
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Purpose:** This document specifies the strategic and operational parameters of the CannaRewards platform.

---

## 1. Business Model & Market Position

**System:** A white-label B2B2C loyalty and data collection platform.
**Client:** Cannabis CPG brands.
**Revenue Model:** Flat-rate monthly subscription fee.
**Service Deliverable:** A technology and service package composed of a Progressive Web App (PWA), backend management, and marketing automation operation. The primary function is to convert physical product packaging into a D2C data channel.

**Target Client Profile (ICP):**
-   **Revenue:** $500,000 to $4,000,000 USD monthly.
-   **Market Rank:** Approximately #10 to #75 by revenue in their state.
-   **Operational Characteristics:** Independent, founder-led CPG brands with demonstrated product-market fit. These entities typically lack dedicated in-house data science, CRM, or software engineering departments.
-   **Non-Target:** Multi-State Operators (MSOs) are excluded due to structural and operational misalignment with the DFY service model.

**Problem Statement:**
Cannabis CPG brands lack a direct data link to end-consumers due to the three-tier distribution system (producer -> distributor -> retailer). This results in zero first-party data regarding consumer demographics or behavior.

**Solution:** The platform establishes this data link by incentivizing consumers to scan an on-pack QR code, enabling direct data capture and communication.

**Long-Term Objective:** To become the dominant D2C intelligence platform for independent cannabis brands, creating a proprietary dataset on consumer behavior that provides a competitive advantage against larger operators.

---

## 2. Go-to-Market & Sales Process

**Pricing Model:**
-   **Rate:** A single, fixed price of $4,000 USD per month.
-   **Scope:** Includes all software features, QR code generation, customer profile storage, and DFY service hours for campaign management.
-   **Client Responsibility:** The client is responsible for the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for all physical reward merchandise.

**Sales Process:**
-   **Method:** A multi-channel outreach ("C-Suite Blitz") targeting C-level executives.
-   **Core Asset:** A non-functional, visually accurate, and client-branded PWA demo, customized via URL parameters.
-   **Value Proposition:** The sales process is a quantitative exercise focused on demonstrating projected ROI. An ROI Scorecard is used to model the financial return based on the client's specific business metrics, justifying the monthly fee as a revenue-generating activity.

---

## 3. User Acquisition Funnel

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** Achieve and sustain a >10% adoption rate (scans per unit sold).

**Physical Asset:** An on-pack, die-cut holographic sticker ("Authenticity Seal") with a direct call-to-action (`SCAN TO STACK`) and a value proposition (`First scan unlocks free gear`).

**Onboarding Workflow:** A sequential process designed to maximize conversion by front-loading value and delaying data input friction.
1.  **Scan:** User scans the QR code.
2.  **Claim:** PWA displays a free physical product.
3.  **Ship:** A modal collects the minimum data required for both account creation and physical shipment (Name, Address, Email, Terms).
4.  **Confirm:** A `claim-unauthenticated` API endpoint executes three actions: creates the user account, generates a zero-dollar WooCommerce order for the gift, and dispatches a magic link email for account activation.
5.  **Activate:** User clicks the magic link to log in, completing the loop.

---

## 4. User Retention & Engagement

**Initial Engagement ("Welcome Streak"):** A predefined, high-value reward schedule for a user's first three scans to establish a behavioral pattern.
-   **Scan 1:** 1x Physical Product + Base Points.
-   **Scan 2:** 2x Point Multiplier.
-   **Scan 3:** 1x Achievement Unlock + Bonus Points.

**Long-Term Engagement (The Wishlist/Goal System):**
-   The primary long-term retention mechanic is a user-defined "Active Goal" selected from their Wishlist. This goal is persistently displayed on the user's dashboard with a progress bar, providing a clear objective for point accumulation.

---

## 5. Points & Rewards Economy

**Point Issuance (Earning):**
-   **Primary Rule:** 10 Points awarded per $1 of the product's MSRP. This requires an `msrp` data field in the client's Product Information Management (PIM) system.
-   **Secondary Rule:** Fixed point amounts awarded via the Achievement and Trigger systems.

**Point Redemption (Spending):**
-   **Primary Rule:** The point cost of a reward is pegged to its hard Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) to the client.
-   **Target Peg:** 1 Point ≈ $0.01 of COGS.

**Economic Model:** The system is calibrated to provide a 7-10% value-back to the end-consumer. This rate is designed to be highly competitive to drive adoption and retention.

---

## 6. Competitive Positioning

The platform is positioned as a new market category to make direct competitors irrelevant.
-   **Not** a simple authentication tool (e.g., Cannverify).
-   **Not** a complex, self-service enterprise platform (e.g., Batch).
-   **Is** a "Done-For-You Customer Intelligence Platform" targeting the specific operational and financial constraints of the mid-market.

---

## 7. Technology Architecture

The system is a decoupled, three-part stack.
-   **Backend:** A headless WordPress installation utilizing a Service-Oriented, Event-Driven architecture. It functions as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) for the PWA.
-   **Frontend:** A Next.js Progressive Web App (PWA) focused on performance and user experience, deployed on a global edge network (Vercel).
-   **Customer Data Platform (CDP):** Customer.io is the designated system for ingesting the enriched event stream from the backend. It handles all user segmentation, marketing automation workflows, and AI-driven personalization.

# CannaRewards Engine

## 🚀 Overview

This is the headless WordPress backend for the CannaRewards D2C Intelligence Platform. It is a custom plugin that provides all necessary API endpoints, a service-oriented business logic layer, and an administrative interface for managing the platform.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A WordPress installation (developed with LocalWP).
- WooCommerce plugin installed and active.
- PHP >= 7.4
- Composer for PHP dependency management.
- Node.js >= 18 (for development tooling like Husky).

## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Clone this project directly into your WordPress site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url] cannarewards-engine
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the plugin directory and run Composer.
    ```bash
    cd cannarewards-engine
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js Dev Dependencies:**
    This is required for the pre-commit hooks to work.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Activate the Plugin:**
    Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard, go to "Plugins", and activate the "CannaRewards Engine" plugin.

5.  **Run the Database Migration:**
    Deactivate and then Reactivate the plugin one time. This will trigger the `activate()` method in `class-canna-db.php` and create the necessary custom database tables.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a service-oriented architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

-   **`/services`**: Contains all core business logic (e.g., `EconomyService`, `GamificationService`). These services are the "brains" of the operation.
-   **`/includes/api`**: Contains the lean REST API controllers. Their only job is to handle incoming requests, call the appropriate service, and format the response.
-   **`/admin`**: Contains the classes for building the WordPress admin UI (metaboxes, settings pages, etc.).
-   **Data Contracts:** The definitive API contract (`openapi.yaml`) and Data Taxonomy are maintained in the central "Living Blueprint" document.

## 🧪 Running Linters

This project uses PHP_CodeSniffer with the WordPress Coding Standards to enforce code quality. This is run automatically on every commit via a Husky pre-commit hook.

To run the linter manually:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpcs
